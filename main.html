	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>An algorithm is considered Time Complexity efficient if it performs a task in the smallest number of operations. Time complexity is a metric that measures how long an algorithm takes to run based on the size of its input. Algorithms with lower time complexity are generally more efficient and can handle larger inputs better.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space. Space complexity is dependent on several factors.</p>
